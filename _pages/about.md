I'm a **PhD student** at University College Cork.
I conduct research within the fields of **Recommender Systems** and **Music Information Retrieval**, supervised
by prof. [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/).

I have a **M.Sc.** in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a **B.Sc.** in Computer Engineering from Università degli studi di Perugia.

# Research
