I'm a **PhD student** at University College Cork.
I conduct research within the fields of **Recommender Systems** and **Music Information Retrieval**, supervised
by prof. [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/).

I have a **M.Sc.** in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a **B.Sc.** in Computer Engineering from UniversitÃ  degli studi di Perugia.

# Research

> The paper **An Interpretable Music Similarity Measure Based on Path Interestingness**, authored by me and [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/), was accepted to ISMIR 2021!

> The paper **Generating Interesting Song-to-Song Segues With Dave**, authored by me and [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/), have won the [James Chen Best Student Paper Award](https://www.um.org/awards/james-chen-best-student-paper-awards) at UMAP 2021!
