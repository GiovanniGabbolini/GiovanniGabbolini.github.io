I'm a **PhD student** at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, University College Cork.
I conduct research within the fields of **Recommender Systems** and **Music Information Retrieval**, supervised
by prof. [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/).

I have a **M.Sc.** in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and a **B.Sc.** in Computer Engineering from Università degli studi di Perugia.

# Research

> Our paper was accepted in ACM Symposium of Applied Computing 2021! **On the instability of embeddings for recommender systems: the case of Matrix Factorization** [(Preprint)](files/NNMF_preprint.pdf)

## Projects
- **Narratives and playlists**  Through the medium of music, playlists tell stories. Click [here](/projects#narratives) to see how we unleash the power of stories behind playlists.
- **Recommender systems and instability** Widely-used Matrix Factorization recommenders are unstable! Interested? Find out more [here](/projects#instability).

And, **that's not it**! Browse all my projects [here](/projects#past).
