My ongoing works are within the fields of recommender systems and music information retrieval:

- [Narrative for Music Information Retrieval](#narratives)
- [Recommender Systems and Instability](#instability)

I did some work in the broader field of artificial intelligence:

- [RecSys Challenge 2019](#recsys_challenge)
- [Face2Face](#face2face)

### Dave

Musical tracks, or songs, are independent entities. Even so, songs are connected by hidden links behind the bare audio wave. **Dave** is a Research prototype by Giovanni Gabbolini and [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/), and is designed to unveil such links, or segues.

**Play with Dave**
Click the Spin button, and check out segues generated by Dave from pairs of randomly-chosen songs.

## • Recommender Systems and Instability
In this project, jointly with Edoardo D'Amico (UCD) and the [RecSys@PoliMi](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it/) group, we show how the output of matrix factorization change when the initialization of embeddings change. We refer to this phenomenon as instability.

We introduce a new family of algorithms that generalize matrix factorizations. The new algorithms are more stable, and have better accuracy on the long-tail.

This project was the subject of a paper and of my M.Sc thesis:

## • ACM RecSys Challenge 2019
I participated to the RecSys Challenge 2019 as a member of the PoliCloud8 team, inside the [RecSys@PoliMi](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it/) group.

The challenge, sponsored by Trivago, focused on travel metasearch. We had to develop a session-based and context-aware recommender system using various input data to provide a list of accommodations matching user needs. We were given a dataset of $20$M interactions, $1$M users and $1$M accommodations.

In the final [leaderboard](https://recsys.trivago.cloud/leaderboard/leaderboard), **our team ranked in the $10^{th}$ position over $575$ teams**.
Our solution was based on a stacked ensemble of three algorithms powered by over $200$ handcrafted features.
We explain in details our solution to the challenge in a paper, published at RecSys:

## • Face2Face
In the context of the Deep Learning class @ Politecnico di Milano, I contributed to design and implement a novel face authentication algorithm. The algorithm is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

For more details, see a [report](files/face2face.pdf) and the [source code](https://github.com/GiovanniGabbolini/face-2-face).
