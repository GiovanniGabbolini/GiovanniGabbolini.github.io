{% include base_path %}

Musical tracks, or songs, are independent entities. Even so, songs are connected by hidden links behind the bare audio wave. **Dave** is a Research prototype by Giovanni Gabbolini and Derek Bridge, and is designed to unveil such links, or segues. Dave's segues strive to be enjoyable, sometimes by being informative, and sometimes by being funny

**Play with Dave**
Click the Spin button, and check out segues generated by Dave from pairs of randomly-chosen songs.
