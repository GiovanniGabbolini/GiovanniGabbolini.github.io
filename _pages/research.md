My ongoing work is within the fields of recommender systems and music information retrieval:

- [Explainability of music playlists](#narratives)

I did some other work in recommender systems and within the broader field of artificial intelligence:

- [Recommender systems and instability](#instability)
- [RecSys Challenge 2019](#recsys_challenge)
- [Face2Face](#face2face)

# Ongoing

## • Explainability of music playlists

### Dave

Musical tracks, or songs, are independent entities. Even so, songs are connected by hidden links behind the bare audio wave. **Dave** is a Research prototype by Giovanni Gabbolini and [Derek Bridge](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dgb/), and is designed to unveil such links, or segues.

**Play with Dave**
Click the Spin button, and check out segues generated by Dave from pairs of randomly-chosen songs.

The paper on Dave was awarded as:
- [James Chen best student paper award](https://www.um.org/index.php/awards/james-chen-best-student-paper-awards) at [UMAP '21](https://www.um.org/umap2021/);
- Best paper award '21 within the school of computer science in UCC.

And, Derek had the chance to talk about our work on the BBC Radio 6 [Radcliffe and Maconie Show](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0100rp6)! [Listen back](files/live.mp3).

### IPSim

We use segues from Dave to build an interpretable and accurate similarity measure, called IPSim.

### Sam

We use segues from Dave to decorate playlists. As such, we create tours, that is a sequence where songs alternate with segues.

## • Recommender Systems and Instability
In this project, jointly with Edoardo D'Amico (UCD) and the [RecSys@PoliMi](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it/) group, we show how the output of matrix factorization change when the initialization of embeddings change. We refer to this phenomenon as instability.

We introduce a new family of algorithms that generalize matrix factorizations. The new algorithms are more stable, and have better accuracy on the long-tail.

This project was the subject of two papers and of my M.Sc thesis:
> **Giovanni Gabbolini**, Edoardo D'Amico, Cesare Bernardis, and Paolo Cremonesi. 2021. [Analyzing and Improving Stability of Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-021-00686-1). In JIIS.

## • ACM RecSys Challenge 2019
I participated to the RecSys Challenge 2019 as a member of the PoliCloud8 team, inside the [RecSys@PoliMi](http://recsys.deib.polimi.it/) group.

The challenge, sponsored by Trivago, focused on travel metasearch. We had to develop a session-based and context-aware recommender system using various input data to provide a list of accommodations matching user needs. We were given a dataset of $20$M interactions, $1$M users and $1$M accommodations.

In the final [leaderboard](https://recsys.trivago.cloud/leaderboard/leaderboard), **our team ranked in the $10^{th}$ position over $575$ teams**.
Our solution was based on a stacked ensemble of three algorithms powered by over $200$ handcrafted features.
We explain in details our solution to the challenge in a paper, published at RecSys:

## • Face2Face
In the context of the Deep Learning class @ Politecnico di Milano, I contributed to design and implement a novel face authentication algorithm. The algorithm is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

For more details, see a [report](files/face2face.pdf) and the [source code](https://github.com/GiovanniGabbolini/face-2-face).
