Musical tracks, or songs, stand as independent entities. Still, songs are connected by hidden links behind the bare audio wave.
Dave is a Research prototype by Giovanni Gabbolini and Derek Bridge, and is designed to unveil such links, or *segues*.
Segues are design to be Enjoyable, and are sometimes informative, and sometimes funny.
