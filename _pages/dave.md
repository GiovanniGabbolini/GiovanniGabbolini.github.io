Musical tracks, or songs, are independent entities. Even so, songs are connected by hidden links behind the bare audio wave. Dave is a Research prototype by Giovanni Gabbolini and Derek Bridge, and is designed to unveil such links, or segues. Dave's segues strive to be enjoyable, sometimes by being informative, and sometimes by being funny

## Play with Dave
Click the Spin button, and check out segues generated by Dave from pairs of randomly-chosen songs.
